    "In TensorFlow the computations are a represented in the form of graphs. Here, graphs are the descriptions of the computations which will be executed when the graphs are launched in a session. Before this launch they are just a “representation” of how the data will flow and what computations will be performed upon this data. Designing a graph is equivalent to designing a solution to a mathematical or a real world problem. Later, we can feed some input data to these graphs and get the desired output data. Nodes in the graphs are called ops (short for operations). These ops again are just representations of the real computations which would occur when the graphs are launched in a session and some data is provided. Here, data is represented by tensors. Tensors are the symbolic handle to the inputs and outputs of the ops. The real concrete values are stored in the form numpy arrays. Tensor does not hold the real values but instead provides a means of computing those values in a TensorFlow Session.\n",

    "The Graph is used to represent a complex TensorFlow computation or a model design solution for a problem. This class contains a set of Tensor objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations and a set of Operation objects, which represent units of computation. These objects are used to design a Graph object. A Graph is a fundamental requirement of executing a TensorFlow computation. Hence, a default Graph is always registered, and accessible by calling tf.get_default_graph(). To add an operation to the default graph, we can simply call one of the functions that defines a new Operation and this operation will be added as a unit of this default Graph. Hence, for a particular process all the operations and tensors defined will be added to the default graph unless we create a graph explicitly and add units to it."
